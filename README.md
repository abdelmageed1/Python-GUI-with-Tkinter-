Welcome to the **Python Desktop Projects** repository! This repository contains various Python projects related to desktop applications, all built using Python and its libraries such as **Tkinter**.

### üìÅ Project Structure

Each project is located in its own separate branch. The main branch of this repository serves as an overview of the entire collection of desktop projects, with each specific project organized under its own branch.

For example:
- **calculator-app**: A simple calculator built using Tkinter (find this in the `calculator-app` branch).
- **other-projects**: Future Python desktop projects will be added here as separate branches.
